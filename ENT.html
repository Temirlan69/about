    <h1>ENT for admission to the grant starts on April 15</h1>
    <div class="panara">
   <h2>ENT for participation in the competition for the award of the state educational grant will begin on April 15 and will last until June 30. For the first time testing is carried out in electronic format. This will ensure the transparency and openness of the ENT procedure.<br>

    <br>An application for a computer ENT can be submitted on the website http://app.testcenter.kz/.<br>
    
    <br>The ENT in electronic format will be organized according to the principle “one test taker - one computer - one camera”. In addition to the front camera, which will broadcast what is happening in the classroom, one more camera will be installed above each table. A modern proctoring and video surveillance system will be provided, as well as Face ID digital identification to exclude dummies on ENT.<br>
    
    
    <br>Compliance with the rules will be monitored by a special computer program that automatically detects the use of prohibited items. If, during the UNT test, it is found that the applicant has used smartphones, cheat sheets, etc., then testing will be automatically terminated and the results will be canceled.<br>
    
    <br>Additional supervision of the testing process will be carried out by the situation center. Also, representatives of the special monitoring group of the Agency for Combating Corruption of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the project office "Adaldyk alagy" will be involved in the ENT to ensure openness and objectivity.</h2>
    <h1>ENT in Kazakhstan - rules and procedure for conducting</h1>
    <h2>Every year in Kazakhstan, those who have graduated from secondary school take the so-called unified national testing (ENT).<br>

        We will try to answer all questions concerning the procedure of the ENT:</h2>
        <div class="dadonov">
        <li>Final certification in schools</li>
        <li>The procedure for the final certification</li>
        <li>The order of passing the ENT</li>
        <li>Registration of an application for the ENT</li>
        <li>Rules of conduct during the ENT</li>
        <li>What to do if you disagree with the results of the ENT</li>
    </div>
    <h2>In general, since last year in Kazakhstan, the level of knowledge acquisition by graduates of secondary schools is checked in two stages:</h2>
    <div class="schools">
    <ol>
        <li>Exams in schools. They are necessary in order to obtain two documents – a certificate of secondary education and "Altyn belgi".</li><br>
        <li>ENT. It is necessary in order to enroll in a higher educational institution in Kazakhstan and apply for one of the state grants.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h2>As for the ENT, it is held for everyone who has completed a general education course - both for graduates of public secondary schools and for graduates of private secondary schools. The subordination of a secondary school does not matter either. If you have decided not to continue studying in our country, but to go abroad to study, then there is no need to come to it.</h2>
<h1>The order of passing the ENT</h1>
<h2>As mentioned earlier, all graduates of general educational institutions are allowed to take the described testing.<br>

    <br>It consists of two parts. The first one includes three academic disciplines, which are passed by all graduates of general educational institutions, no matter what they specialized in (mathematics, humanities or natural sciences). These three academic disciplines are:</h2>
    <div class="dadonov">
        <li>mathematical literacy;</li>
        <li>reading literacy, in particular, the establishment of the ability to generalize information, compare facts, compare objects, etc.;</li>
        <li>history of Kazakhstan.</li>
    </div>
    <h2>There are 20 exercises in each of the exams.<br>

        <br>In turn, the second one includes two academic disciplines that are passed on the basis of specialization. These two academic disciplines include:</h2>
        <div class="dadonov">
            <li>mathematics and physics;</li>
            <li>mathematics and geography;</li>
            <li>history and geography;</li>
            <li>biology and chemistry;</li>
            <li>biology and geography;</li>
            <li>foreign language and history;</li>
            <li>language of instruction and literature and history;</li>
            <li>geography and foreign language;</li>
            <li>chemistry and physics;</li>
            <li>history and Man. Society. Right.</li>
        </div>
        <h2>Other combinations are also possible. More detailed information on this and other issues related to the UNT can be found on the official website of the National Testing Center.<br>

            <br>There are 30 exercises in each subject.<br>
            
           <br>There are two types of exercises in compulsory subjects:</h2>
         <div class="schools">
             <ol>
                 <li>Those in which it is required to mark one option out of five. If the answer is correct, then one point is awarded.</li><br>
                 <li>Those in which you want to mark one or more options from the set. If the answer is correct, then two points are awarded.</li>
             </ol>
         </div>
         <h2>And in specialized subjects , exercises are divided into two types:</h2>
         <div class="schools">
             <ol>
                 <li>Those in which you need to specify one option of their five. There are twenty of them.</li><br>
                 <li>Those in which you need to specify one option from the set. There are ten of them.</li>
             </ol>
         </div>
         <h2>This approach is aimed at checking the level of mastering knowledge on a specific topic. With it, there is a very low risk that a person will memorize or guess the correct answers.<br>

            <br>Thus, there are 120 tasks in the UNT in total. The duration of the exam is 3 hours and 50 minutes. The minimum number of points required to obtain a satisfactory grade is 50. The maximum number of points is 140, for those who plan to study in one of the creative programs – 120.<br>
            
            <br>The annual campaign to accept applications for the Unified National Testing (UNT) lasts from March 10 to May 10. The exam dates are from June 20 to July 1.<br>
            
            <br>If you can't get a passing score on the UNT the first time or want to improve the result, then you will have the opportunity to take the UNT again. However, you will have to pay a fee of 2242 tenge.<br>
            
            <br>If you miss the UNT for a good reason, for example, because of poor health, confirmed by a medical certificate, then you will have the opportunity to take the UNT again. To do this, you need to contact the commission staff.<br>
            
            <br>Those who have "Altyn Belgi", those who are the winner or prize-winner of the state or international Olympiad, pass the UNT together with everyone. But with the same number of points, they are in priority. Winners and prize-winners of five international Olympiads are awarded with state grants.</h2>
